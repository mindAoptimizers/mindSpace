          <li>Hi my name's Alex i'm an upcoming Python Software Dev. Before codefellow I worked at Apple, OfferUp, and even on a presidential campaign. I'm super interested in software development because anyone can really do this with the right tools and training you can literally build something as cool as google....(Lots more time needed for that).</li>
          <li> I'm focusing on Python development because of how interested I am in machine learning its just so cool having a machine learn its something out of a movie and something I can talk about all day. I'd really love to work as a Machine learning engineer at pretty much any company but google or nasa would be my dream places.</li>
          <li>Before deciding to work in the dev world I came from the IT and Ops side of the Tech world so I have you covered if you need help setting up your WiFi. My background working for Apple has give me a great attention for detail (Apple plans literally every cm most projects they work on) and a fantastic ability to work with all types of folks. </li>
