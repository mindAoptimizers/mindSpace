*A place you can journal… Peacefully.*

- An area where you can put your developer notes, learning, and thoughts of the day in one place. 

- Gives developers a place to refer to previous learnings and review daily thoughts. Places different categories where a user can input what type of journal entry they would like to have private or share personally. The biggest benefit is that we will have no advertisements on our journaling website which gives the user a detachment from the daily consumerism distraction of the world, plus it’s free!

- MVP (Minimum Viable Product): Be able to add, edit, and delete an entry for the user’s journal. Make sure that it has some styling if anything, minimum styling. Have an about page made for the content that was created.
